## Part 1: Implementing Convolution Function From Scratch
Here is a plot of the result of the convolution between x and y with both the [built-in](https://github.com/fardinabbasi/Signal_Processing/blob/main/Conv.m) and [Scratch](https://github.com/fardinabbasi/Signal_Processing/blob/main/Convolution.m) functions.

$x = [2,-2,7,-3,2,4,-6,1]$

$y = [5,2,4,-6,5,1,-8,0,7,2,9]$
